# Stardew MCP Bridge

AI companions for Stardew Valley, controlled through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Spawn one or more autonomous NPC companions with custom sprites that can follow the player, farm, mine, fish, and fight — all driven by MCP tool calls from an AI agent.

**SMAPI Mod** (`smapi-mod/`): Runs inside the game. Spawns companion NPCs with shadow `Farmer` instances for game mechanics (tools, combat, fishing). Writes game state to `bridge_data.json`, reads commands from `actions.json`.

**MCP Server** (`mcp-server/`): Exposes 13 tools over stdio transport. Reads game state and sends commands by reading/writing the bridge JSON files.

## Companion System

Each companion is a visible NPC paired with a hidden "shadow farmer" that handles game mechanics:

- **NPC** — Custom sprite, pathfinding, visible to the player
- **Shadow Farmer** — Extends `Farmer` class, holds tools/inventory, performs tool use, combat, and fishing through actual game APIs

### Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `follow` | Follow the player between locations, fight if monsters nearby |
| `farm` | Scan for crops to water/harvest, clear debris |
| `mine` | Fight monsters, break rocks, seek ladders |
| `fish` | Find water, cast rod, auto-hook fish |
| `idle` | Stay in place |

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `stardew_get_state` | Get current game state (time, weather, player stats, companion status) |
| `stardew_spawn` | Spawn companions near the player |
| `stardew_follow` | Set all companions to follow mode |
| `stardew_stay` | Set all companions to idle |
| `stardew_farm` | Enable autonomous farming |
| `stardew_mine` | Enable combat/mining mode |
| `stardew_fish` | Enable fishing mode |
| `stardew_water_all` | Instantly water all unwatered crops |
| `stardew_harvest_all` | Instantly harvest all ready crops |
| `stardew_warp` | Warp companions to a location |
| `stardew_set_mode` | Set an individual companion's mode |
| `stardew_chat` | Send a message to the game chat |
| `stardew_action` | Send a custom action command |

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) (1.6+)
- [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/) (4.0+)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (18+)

### 1. Build the SMAPI Mod

```bash
cd smapi-mod

# Set your Stardew Valley install path
export GAME_PATH="C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Stardew Valley"

dotnet build
```

The build will automatically deploy to your `Mods/` folder.

### 2. Add Companion Assets

Place your custom sprites and portraits in `smapi-mod/assets/`:

- `Companion1_sprite.png` — 64x128 sprite sheet (4x4 grid, 16x32 per frame)
- `Companion1_portrait.png` — Portrait image
- `Companion2_sprite.png` — 64x128 sprite sheet
- `Companion2_portrait.png` — Portrait image

Sprite sheets follow the standard Stardew Valley format: 4 columns (walk frames) x 4 rows (down, right, up, left).

### 3. Build the MCP Server

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

### 4. Configure Your AI Agent

Add to your MCP client config (e.g., Claude Code's `settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stardew": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "STARDEW_BRIDGE_PATH": "path/to/Mods/StardewMCPBridge/bridge_data.json",
        "STARDEW_ACTION_PATH": "path/to/Mods/StardewMCPBridge/actions.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you're running both from the repo directory, the env vars are optional — it defaults to `../../smapi-mod/` relative paths.

### 5. Play

1. Launch Stardew Valley with SMAPI
2. Load a save
3. Use `stardew_spawn` to bring companions into the world
4. Set modes with `stardew_farm`, `stardew_mine`, `stardew_fish`, or `stardew_follow`

## Notes (v0.2.0)

Recent fixes and improvements:

- **Farm mode freeze fix** — Companions no longer get permanently stuck when pathfinding stalls. Stuck detection (2s threshold) auto-retargets to the next task.
- **Mine mode ladder descent** — Companions actually descend mine levels now instead of just standing near ladders.
- **Fishing timeout** — Fishing no longer hangs forever on a bad cast. Auto-resets after ~5 seconds with no bite.
- **Crash isolation** — One companion crashing no longer freezes all companions. Each ticks independently with error recovery.
- **Shadow farmer sync** — Shadow farmer syncs position from the visible NPC every tick, preventing desync drift.
- **Day transition safety** — Companions in mines/dungeons at day end are warped to the farm. Mode resets to Follow on new day.
- **Atomic file writes** — MCP server writes actions to a temp file then renames, preventing the SMAPI mod from reading partial JSON.
- **Input validation** — MCP tools with required arguments now validate before sending, returning clear error messages.

Fix Farm mode stuck bug + Follow mode improvements
Bug fix:
- Farm mode companions would permanently freeze when pathfinding
  stalled. The NPC had a target and reported "moving" in the bridge,
  but wasn't actually getting closer. Added stuck detection: if
  position hasn't changed in 60 ticks (~1s), clears the target and
  rescans for new tasks.

Follow mode improvements:
- Added teleport fallback when >10 tiles from player (prevents
  long pursuit delays)
- Added teleport fallback when pathfinding throws (was silently
  catching with no recovery)
- Reduced pathCooldown from 30 to 4 ticks for more responsive
  following

PathTo helper:
- Added teleport-to-target fallback when pathfinding fails
- Reduced pathCooldown from 15 to 4 ticks
